OpenPDI is an unofficial effort to document and standardize data submitted to the `Police Data Initiative <https://www.policedatainitiative.org/>`_. Our goal is to make the data more accessible by releasing

addressing some of the difficulties researchers are likely to run into -- namely,

* **Fastest syntactic parser** in the world
* **Named entity** recognition
* Non-destructive **tokenization**
* Support for **20+ languages**
